       <li>  Lifecycle Emissions: The carbon footprint of a device essentially consists of extraction of raw materials, production itself, and transportation, alongside eventual disposal </li>

       <li> Mining of Rare Earth Elements and Metals: Key ingredients, including lithium for batteries, cobalt, gold, and tantalum, must be mined. Each mining process leads to the degradation of ecosystems and communities, hence causing habitat loss. Rare earth mining could often produce toxic by-products and heavy metal contamination, thus polluting soil and water. </li>
       <li> Deforestation: Land clearing due to mining contributes to deforestation, hence causing a loss in biodiversity and carbon storage capacity. </li>
