                    <li> Mining of Rare Earth Elements and Metals: Key ingredients, including lithium for batteries, cobalt, gold, and tantalum, must be mined. Each mining process leads to the degradation of ecosystems and communities, hence causing habitat loss. Rare earth mining could often produce toxic by-products and heavy metal contamination, thus polluting soil and water. </li>
                    <li> Deforestation: Land clearing due to mining contributes to deforestation, hence causing a loss in biodiversity and carbon storage capacity. </li>

           <li> Data Centers: Every online activity, be it streaming, cloud storage, or web browsing, relies on data centers housing servers. These centers consume a lot of energy and generate heat, which requires more energy in the form of cooling systems. Data centers are estimated to account for 1-2% of global electricity usage. </li>

           <li> Lack Of Recycling: Most of the people do not recycle old devices; hence, non-biodegradable parts pile up in landfills. </li>
